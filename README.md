But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which
He loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us
alive together with Christ - by grace you have been saved.

## Introduction

And raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in
Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasureable
riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

## Purpose

For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing;
it is the gift of God, not a result of works so that no man may boast.

## Deployment

For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
